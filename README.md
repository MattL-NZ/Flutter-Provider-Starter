# A Flutter starter project using Provider State Management and get_it Dependency Injection

This is a starter project for building apps with the Provider state management framework. Instead of using the default dependency injection Provider uses, we are using get_it,

The layout and sample build is based off [this guide:](https://www.filledstacks.com/post/flutter-architecture-my-provider-implementation-guide).
